This is a convolutional neural network for decoding motion imagery of index finger and thumb of the left and right hands, written in Keras and Tensorflow. 

To run the  classification sample script, you will need:

   Python == 3.7 or 3.8
   tensorflow == 2.X (2.0 - 2.3)
   mne >= 0.17.1
   PyRiemann >= 0.2.5
   scikit-learn >= 0.20.1
   matplotlib >= 2.2.3

   The sample data was collected by the Geodesic EEG System 400, it has 256 channels and a sampling rate of 250H, and is filtered at 4~40Hz.
